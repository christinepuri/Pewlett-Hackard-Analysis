  - Before updating the table to only show the most recent titles of employees, the "retirement_title.csv" file shows that several employees who are now eligible for retirement where promoted from Staff to Senior Staff and Engineer to Senior Engineer. The table above shows that 14222 Engineers and 12243 Staff are eligible for retirment, so there may be room for engineers and staff to be promoted.
